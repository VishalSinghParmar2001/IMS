A project on Inventory Management system as part of my Internship.

The IMS has 2 modes

1.Billing

2.Admin

1. Billing

     As part of the bill you get the
     
     	1.Name of the product
     
     	2.Rate
     
     	3.Quantity Bought
     
     	4.Total(Quantity*Rate)
2. Admin

	As part of the admin menu
	   
	   1.Add items to the inventory
	   
	   2.You can add to the quantity of existing item in the Inventory
    	   
	   3.You can remove from the quantity of existing item in the Inventory

The Inventory is updated everytime the a billing or a change is made to the inventory by admin.

A record of every sale is maintained in the Sales.txt file.
